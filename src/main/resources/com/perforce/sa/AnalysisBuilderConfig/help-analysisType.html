  Select which type of analysis you wish to run.

  Baseline - Performs a project baseline scan using the either kwbuildproject (Klocwork) or 'qacli validate build'
  (Helix QAC). This scan will detect all the issues within the project and upload the full list to the validate portal.
  <br><br>
  Delta - Performs a project scan ( optionally restricted on a source file list ), that only reports the potential new
  issues in difference to the last baseline scan. This uses the kwciagent (Klocwork) tool or 'qacli validate cibuild'
  (Helix QAC) tool. The intention of the delta analysis is to be used as part of a quality gate workflow in merge
  requests. Blocking acceptance of merge requests if the merge were to introduce new issues to a protected branch,
  which the baseline scan is run on
