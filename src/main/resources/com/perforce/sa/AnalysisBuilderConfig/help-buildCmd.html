<div>
  Provide the build command to wrap and capture the compilation data from, i.e 'make'. Note in cases where environments
  or configuration needs to be run before the build command this field is a multi-line field. Only the last command
  will be captured and thus should be the build command. For example:
  <br><br>
  ./configure<br>make
  <br><br>
  Would run ./configure followed by make, the capture of compilations would be on the make process.
