  If performing a delta analysis with the Klocwork engine you may provide the path to text file that contains 
  a list of files present in the build specifcation to restrict the analysis to. An example command to generate 
  this might be: 'git diff --name-only origin/master > restriction_list.txt'

  The required format fo the contents being, restriction_list.txt:

  sourceFileA.cpp
  sourceFileB.cpp
  sourceFileC.c
  ...

  Note that files not present in the build specifcation can be included, however they will be ignored by the analysis.
